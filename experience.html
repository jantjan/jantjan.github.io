            MIT BioMakers
        </h2>
        MIT BioMakers is a newly formed group that is located in MITâ€™s Huang Hobbs BioMakerSpace. We host student projects and help run educational workshops in the space. I am motivated to make sure that the BioMakers group develops a strong foundation for future growth and to build a welcoming BioMaking community at MIT. 

As current co-chair of the student group that occupies the state, I have helped organized focused initiatives on expanding our community and creating the foundations for student-led projects.
