                <h2> Listening in! What will the Convergence of Hearing Aid and Hearable Design Look like? </h2>
                In general, I am interested in the wearables space and the blurring lines between 'health' and 'medical' technology. For my undergraduate design thesis, I am focused on a subset of wearables: hearables.
                <br><br>  The deregulations of OTC hearing aids have paved new paths for consumers with low to moderate hearing loss to acquire low-cost hearing assistance devices. Companies that have been at the forefront of hearable (e.g. conventional earbuds) technology have recognized the opportunity gap and are eager to enter this product space.
                <br><br> Despite having more access to these devices, will consumers readily adopt the next generation of hearing assistance devices, or will persistent stigma and narratives of aging get in the way? Can we envision more socially agile forms for these devices or will we adopt new norms to adapt to these changes?

                <h2> Bits in Bites! Learning What it Takes to Build a Website </h2>  
                For the past three years, I have been co-leading the development of a website for my student club, the Educational Studies Program (MIT ESP). The website is not only the face of an organization that serves thousands of students and teachers year-round but also houses critical logistical operations like scheduling massive catalogs of classes.                
                <br><br>Starting in the Fall of 2021, my team worked with Zagaran to build the complex and critical foundations of this website. Beginning this Spring, we are entering a stage of self-development! This rag-tag band of MIT students is learning the ropes of web development and experiencing all the growing pains that come with it.
                <br><br> Apart from keeping progress on track, I am honing my UX/UI skills by protyping user workflows on Figma and XD <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/ede15392-3929-426f-8e85-9e596217a708-b8b2/">(example viewable here)</a> and also using my own website as grounds to experiment with HTML and CSS.

                <h2> Crossing my T's... and all the other letters   </h2> 
                I aim to complete a series of letter sets I began to develop as a student of Visual Communications, taught by Bo Won Keum. This series is called CROSSTYPE and consists of letters formed by the movement of people on a crosswalk at different times of day. Check out a demo video of the type on my Youtube channel.
